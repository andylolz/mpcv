        <h2>Why are you collecting CVs?</h2>

        <p>Sending a CV is usually the very first step of a job application.
        </p>

        <p>We believe it should also be the first step when people apply to become an MP.</p>

        <p>Voters can then look at the CVs, and assess skills and
        abilities before choosing who is best.
        </p>

        <h2>What can I do here?</h2>

        <p>You can browse the CVs we've already got, and
        ask your candidates to upload missing ones.
        </p>

        <h2>Why should candidates do this?</h2>

        <p>To be helpful to voters, so they can choose the best candidate.
        </p>

        <p>These articles give further motivation:

        <h2>What's the long term aim?</h2>

        <p>Ultimately, we'd like the public to be more involved in the
        recruitment of MPs in lots of ways. Perhaps we can increase the
        quality, giving Prime Ministers more choice of high calibre people for
        senior roles.

        <h2>Who's behind this site?</h2>

        <p>Julian Todd had the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/may/04/general-election-2010">original idea</a>
        back in 2010. He got it from his <a href="https://electionleaflets.org/">election leaflets project</a>.
        </p>

        <p><a href="http://flourish.org/">Francis Irving</a> made the site.
        He built a large part of the original TheyWorkForYou, back in the day.
